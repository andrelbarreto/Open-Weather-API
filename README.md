This is a Git Hub repository for the NU Coding Bootcamp Homework 6 weather dashboard.

Purpose
This weather dashboard can be used for searching current weather and forecast conditions of U.S. cities based on user search.

Usage
The user will be able to enter the name of the city and initiate a search that will trigger AJAX calls that return specific values, like UV Index, temperture and humidity of city. The forecast will display the next 5 days beyond the current date and provide the same details.

User will be able to view same cities searched even if the browser is closed and reopened, as clicking save will add the searches to local storage. Last searched city will display at startup. If nothing has been previously searched, Chicago will show as an example by default on the page.

The application will run in the browser and can be used for helping plan future events to different cities or locations.
